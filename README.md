# Demo Application for SQL injection tutorials

This is a demo application for the article, [TypeORM - Prevent SQL Injection with Node.js/React/TypeScript in 2021](https://dev.to/yoshi_yoshi/typeorm-prevent-sql-injection-with-node-js-react-typescript-in-2021-1go4) in [DEV Community](https://dev.to/).

The project has two servers which are an API and a React applicaiton servers. You have two options to start them.

### Start applicaitons with docker-compose
docker-compose up --build
